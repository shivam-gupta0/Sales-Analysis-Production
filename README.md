# Sales-Analysis-Production
Sales Analysis Production is a Jupyter Notebook that merges and analyzes sales data, and identifies top-selling products, optimal advertising time, and frequently co-occurring products, providing valuable insights for sales optimization.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (`Sales_Analysis_Production.ipynb`) that performs sales analysis on a dataset. The analysis includes merging 12 months of sales data, data cleaning, and formatting, identifying the best month for sales, determining the city with the maximum orders, analyzing the optimal time for displaying advertisements, identifying the top-selling product, and finding frequently co-occurring products.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need the following:

- Python 3.9 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-analysis-production.git



2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

cd sales-analysis-production
jupyter notebook



3. Open the `Sales_Analysis_Production.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Run the notebook cells to perform the sales analysis and view the results.

## Dataset

The sales data is stored in separate CSV files for each month. The notebook merges the 12 months of data into a single CSV file (`all_data.csv`) for analysis. The dataset contains information such as order date, product details, quantity ordered, price each, purchase address, etc.

## Results

The notebook generates various visualizations and insights from the sales data, including:
